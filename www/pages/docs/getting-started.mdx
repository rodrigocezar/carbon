# Getting Started

Before getting started with development, it's good to have a basic understanding of our [tech stack](/docs/tech-stack).

You'll also need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) and [yarn installed](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)
on your system since this monorepo uses the yarn package manager.

After running the steps below you should be able to access the following apps/containers locally:

| Application     | URL                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Carbon ERP      | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)                                                                     |
| Postgres        | [postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres](postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres) |
| Supabase Studio | [http://localhost:54323/project/default](http://localhost:54323/project/default)                                   |
| Inbucket        | [http://localhost:54324/monitor](http://localhost:54324/monitor)                                                   |
| Redis           | [redis://localhost:6379](redis://localhost:6379)                                                                   |

First download and initialize the repository dependencies.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/barbinbrad/carbon
$ yarn             # install dependencies
$ yarn init        # pull and start the containers
```

Copy the environment variables from the initialization script to an `.env` file:

```bash
$ cp ./.env.example ./.env
```

After you've set the enviroment variables to the output of `yarn init` you can run

```bash
$ nvm use           # use node v18
$ yarn db:build     # run db migrations and seed script
$ yarn build        # build the packages
```

Finally, start the apps and packages:

```bash
$ yarn dev         # yarn dev in all apps & packages
```

To kill the database containers in a non-recoverable way, you can run:

```bash
$ yarn db:kill   # stop and delete all database containers
```

To restart and reseed the database, you can run:

```bash
$ yarn db:build # runs db:kill, db:start, and setup
```
