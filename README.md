# Carbon ERP

Carbon is a high permformance, open-source, single tenant (incomplete) ERP written in Typescript. It allows customers, suppliers, and employees to share a common platform that's easy to integrate with.

Technical highlights/roadmap:

- [x] Full-stack type safety (Datbase → UI)
- [x] Realtime database subscriptions
- [x] Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- [x] Row-level security (RLS)
- [x] Composable user groups
- [x] Magic link authentication
- [x] File-based routing
- [ ] Third-party integrations for data
- [ ] Easy-to-use plugin system

Product highlights/roadmap are:

- [x] Search
- [x] Customer and supplier access
- [ ] Double-entry accrual accounting
- [ ] Stochastic scheduling/planning
- [ ] Graph-based routing for manufacturing

## Project Status

- [x] Pre-Alpha: Developing foundation
- [ ] Alpha: Heavy feature development and refinement
- [ ] Public Alpha: Ready for use. But go easy on us, there'll be bugs.
- [ ] Public Beta: Stable enough for most non-enterprise use-cases.
- [ ] Public: Production-ready

## Codebase

The monorepo follows the Turborepo covention of grouping packages into one of two folders.

1. `/apps` for applications
2. `/packages` for shared code

### `/apps`

## Local Development

Make sure that you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) on your system since this monorepo uses the Docker for local development.

After running the steps below you should be able to access the following apps/containers locally:

| Application     | URL                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Carbon ERP      | [http://localhost:3600](http://localhost:3600)                                                                     |
| Shared Server   | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)                                                                     |
| Postgres        | [postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres](postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres) |
| Supabase Studio | [http://localhost:54323/project/default](http://localhost:54323/project/default)                                   |
| Inbucket        | [http://localhost:54324/monitor](http://localhost:54324/monitor)                                                   |
| Redis           | [redis://localhost:6379](redis://localhost:6379)                                                                   |
| Edge Functions  | [http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/<function-name>](http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/<function-name>)         |

First download and initialize the repository dependencies.

```bash
$ nvm use           # use node v20
$ npm install       # install dependencies
$ npm run db:start  # pull and run the containers
```

Copy the environment variables from the initialization script to an `.env` file:

```
$ cp ./.env.example ./.env
```

After you've set the enviroment variables to the output of `npm run db:start` you can run

```bash
$ npm run db:build     # run db migrations and seed script
$ npm run build        # build the packages
```

Finally, start the apps and packages:

```bash
$ npm run dev         # npm run dev in all apps & packages
```

To kill the database containers in a non-recoverable way, you can run:

```bash
$ npm run db:kill   # stop and delete all database containers
```

To restart and reseed the database, you can run:

```bash
$ npm run db:build # runs db:kill, db:start, and setup
```

To run a particular application, use the `-w workspace` flag.

For example, to run test command in the `@carbon/react` package you can run:

```
$ npm run test -w @carbon/react
```
